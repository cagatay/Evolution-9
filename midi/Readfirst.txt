ULTIMATE GM/GS Soundfont

THIS ONLY WORKS WITH IF YOU HAVE EIGHT MEGS ON YOUR SB/32/64!!!!!!

GM/GS Compatible Soundfont

I got sick and tired of all the other junky GM/GS eight meg soundfonts so I made one with REALLY GOOD samples.  And the Drumsets are actually unique from one another... Anyways I can't say much, you'll just have to listen. I spent about 6 months on this thing so the best thank you would be to hear your comments.  So drop me a line.  Also, Sorry for any inconvience geocities has caused... The keyword is "free".

I'd also like to thank Uros Katic, he helped me a little on the way. Visit him at http://uts.ml.org/powergm/ He'll have a new site soon... He's working on "sonoro" For SB/live soundcards.. The Live is capable of allocating 32 megs max memory for soundfonts.. he's making the soundfont to sell on CD.. Check it out.



You can do whatever u want with it, but just don't screw it up and sell or pass it out as yours.
